- Add a README
- Add a Makefile
- Add documentation

- Raster.hs:
 - Add functions for ANDing, ORing, and XORing two Bitmaps together
 - Add resizing and/or scaling functions?
 - Add a function for combining two or more Rasters into a single image?
 - Add a function for invoking 'ixmap' on a Raster's internal array
 - Possibly add map functions with the type signatures:
  - (Coord -> a -> Coord) -> Raster a -> Raster a
  - (Coord -> a -> (Coord, b)) -> Raster a -> Raster b
 - Add functions for importing & exporting NetPBM images
 - Switch the names of the {to,from}Pixels and {to,from}List functions?
 - Add a readXPM function that constructs a Raster of a custom tagged union of
   RGB values, HSV values, symbolic names, and "None"
  - Add an advanced alternative to exportXPM that uses the above datatype
 - Add a Bitmap constructor that takes a [Coord]?

- Raytrace.hs:
 - Implement the following objects:
  - solid balls
  - filled cylinders
  - unfilled cylinders with bases
  - sections of spheres?
  - discs?
  - parallelipipeds
   - blocks (rectangular prisms), filled and unfilled
  - tori
 - Implement surfaces for which coloring is a function of location
 - How should polygons handle rays lying within their plane?
 - 'sphere' and 'cylinderShell': Handle 'orig' being on the surface
 - How should insideness be determined for rays lying within a plane or
   cylinderShell?
 - Figure out why 'plane' seems to return a negated normal when both the input
   normal and `d' are negated (cf. the differences in shadowing when the latter
   two vector arguments to 'parallelogram' or 'triangle' in scene01.txt are
   transposed or when the `n' value passed to 'regular' is negated)
 - Continue following along with
   <http://www.devmaster.net/articles/raytracing_series/part3.php> (stopped
   while trying to figure out why his refraction results are slightly different
   from mine)

- tracer.hs:
 - Add options for setting the width, height, and outfile
 - Add an option for setting the recursion depth
 - Improve the input file format?
 - Change some of the instances of `readSFloat` (e.g., when reading radii) to
   `readS_to_P readFloat`
